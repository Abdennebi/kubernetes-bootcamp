# Objectives 

- Scale an app usgin `kubectl`

Scaling is accomplished by changing the number of `replicas` in a deployment

Scaling up a Deployment will ensure new Pods are created and scheduled to Nodes with available resources.

Services have an integrated load balancer that will distribute network traffic to all Pods of an exposed Deployment.

Services will monitor continuously the running Pods using endpoints, to ensure the traffic is sent only to available Pods.
