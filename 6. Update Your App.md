# Objectives

Perform a rolling update with zero downtime

Rolling updates allow Deployments' update to take place with zero downtime by incrementally updating Pods instances with new ones.

Updates are versioned and any deployment update can be reverted to previous (stable) version.

## Update a deployed application with kubectl set image and to rollback with the rollout undo command


- Run a describe command against the Pods to view the current image version of the app

`kubectl describe pods`

- update the image of the application to version 2

`kubectl set image deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp kubernetes-bootcamp=jocatalin/kubernetes-bootcamp:v2`

## Step 2 : Verify an update

- check that the App is running. To find out the exposed IP and Port 

`kubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp`

- The update can be confirmed also by running a rollout status command:

`kubectl rollout status deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp`
